Magic 8-Ball Simulator
This Python program simulates a Magic 8-Ball using a graphical interface. It animates the 8-ball and provides randomized answers to user questions.

Features:
1.Interactive Animation: The 8-ball image moves around the canvas before revealing the answer.
2.Randomized Responses: The program gives one of five possible responses: yes, no, maybe, ask again later, or I hope not.
3.Simple GUI: Built with tkinter, featuring an input box for questions and a button to trigger the animation and response.

How It Works:
1.Ask a question by typing into the input box.
2.Click the "Go" button to trigger the 8-ball animation.
3.The 8-ball moves and then displays a random response on the screen.
4.After a few seconds, the response resets, ready for the next question.
